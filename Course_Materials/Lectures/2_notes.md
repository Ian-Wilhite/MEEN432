## project 0 due on sat

kinda important that we can use matlab 
its just the matlab and simulink certs

### install Toolboxs:
 * MATLAB
 * Simulink
 * Stateflow
 * Automated Driving

## State transitions 

state must contain all data about a given point in time 

start with x_dot = f(x, u) -> change in state as a function of state and input

## euler integrations

x_t = x_0 + int(0, t, x_dot)
x_t = x_0 + int(0, t, f(x, u))

meen 357 the integral is the function * small time, finer simulation parameters are going to take longer

## introduction to project 1

Teams will be posted by monday (after add-drop ends)

### kinda review from 357

### instructions 
* 2.a (w_0 = 1.0) [rad/s]
* 2.b (J = 1) [kg m^2]
* 2.c (b = 1) [N-m/(rad/s)]
* 2.d.i (A = 1) [N-m]
* 2.e.i Fixed Time Step: (0.001, 0.1, 1 s)
 - Euler Solver
 - Runge Kutta 4th Order Solver
* 2.f Total simulation time of 25 seconds
* write a readme about how it works (very chat-friendly)

### advice
* you should use variables so that you can iterate through them
* learn your python one-line loops, theyre helpful when you want to do things with vecors/matricies
* there will be write ups, they are important
* there are resources are online, please use it 
* chatgpt is a tool, but its kinda bad at dyanmics, use it but dont trust it
* dont submit your code to your project lead, submit it to the actual assignment
* peer evals are a tool, please use them (honestly)
